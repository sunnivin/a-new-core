# By exploiting these tools one can do

 

- CI/CD:
  - Perform automatic format checks 
  - Run automatic tests when code base is changing 
- Facilitates 
  - Roll back functionality
  - Code review 
- Etc.

# How to improve in a sustainable way?

## Suggestions
- Introduce a minimum required standard to be used in projects
- Create an environment for talking about technical computer stuff 
  - Low-key "office hours" role 
  - Internal project to write hours for infrastructure/setting up tools on 
  - L&L inspired technical talks 
- Create NGI adapted guides for installation instructions 
- Even more convincing and very long point that will cause the text formatting to break
